    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      A young archaeologist named Maya discovers a mysterious map hidden inside an ancient book. 
      The map leads her to a forgotten city buried deep in the Amazon rainforest. With the help 
      of her childhood friend, she sets off on a dangerous journey filled with puzzles, traps, and 
      rival treasure hunters. As Maya unlocks the secrets of the city, she realizes it’s not just 
      about treasure—it’s about protecting a powerful artifact that could change the fate of humanity. 
      In the end, she must decide between personal glory and saving the world from falling into the wrong hands.
